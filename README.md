Introduction

Welcome to Slot Jack, a simplified version of Blackjack and my first project at General Assembly!

 Blackjack (or 21) is a game first mentioned by Miguel de Cervantes in the 17th century. The rules are as follows: You got 3 cards. Each card is worth its respective value e.g. a 7 is worth 7 points. Kings, Queens and Jacks are worth 10 points. Aces are either worth 11 or 1 point depending on your hand.You have 3 rolls to gather 21 points or less. Do not exceed 21 points or you will go bust and lose!You are able to hold on to or 'fix' a card if you believe it will benefit you on your next roll.You have a pot of 100 dollars, don't deplete it if you don't want to owe to the dealer.

This game was an ambitious idea for a first project but I would like to believe that with the help of my precious instructors and fellow students I have managed to overcome a challenge which seemed to me at the time unreachable.

Project Brief

Create a game using everything we've learned in the first 2 weeks of the WDI course.
Make it object oriented if possible.

Made with:

Stress

HTML,CSS, Javascript and jQuery

Stress

Google Fonts

A terrible sense of humour

What can be improved

A lot of things for sure! 

First of all the code could be a lot cleaner and refactored. Definitely something to work on in the future.

Other than that I would like the styling of the main logo to be a little bit different and potentially animated.

Talking about animations I wanted to add a few more animations when the player wins or loses but I was not happy with just implementing gifs or images for that.

The game currently is not responsive at all but I would like to at least attempt a responsive solution for it which would also be user friendly. Accessibility is also something to be considered.



Credits

All of the images are a result of frantic Google-ing and I am fairly positive that they are free to use.
All sounds were found on https://www.freesound.org/ and were tweeked in Audacity

All this would not have been possible without the immense help of GA instructors Alex Chin and Rane Gowan and TAs Ed Compton and Natalie Huitson.
